Check out the "install.pl" program.  You'll want to look at the variables
up at the top of the script.  By default, freq will be installed into
/usr/local.  If you don't like that prefix, change the $PREFIX variable as
you see fit.

If you've installed my "rotfl" program, you may with to set the
ROTFL_PREFIX variable in "install.pl".  Setting this variable will give
the location of a directory for the rotfl page to be installed to.

Most people should just run install.pl as root and it'll be fine.

The first thing that the install program will do is attempt to find several
programs that are required for the rest of the installation.  Then, it will
attempt to figure out what OS you are using.  In the case of a Linux
system, it will also attempt to figure out what version of the C library
you are using.  These results will then be used to write the final script.
