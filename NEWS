version 1.0.3
=============
- Added support for FreeBSD.  (Contributed by Ying-Chieh Liao)

version 1.0.2
=============
- Followed the advice on page 706 of _Programming Perl_, Third Edition
  regarding eval blocks.  The evals that were used to piece together
  variable names have been removed since we can just use symbolic
  references instead.  This results in a noticable speedup.
- Modified the help screen.
- Removed check for rootness from the installer.

version 1.0.1
=============
- Made a lot of changes to the install script:
    - Removed dependance on "uname", since we can get the same information
      from some Perl variables (Perl is so cool :)
    - Removed fatal dependance on ldd, since it isn't found on all systems
    - Now use PATH environment variable as the path.
    - Removed dependance on GNU install, opting instead for chmod and chown.
      Again, this program isn't found on all platforms.
    - Cleaned up a lot of the code.  It was pretty ugly.
    - Reversed how it looks for programs ("This would be easier if we
      did it backwards").
    - Make the directory tree if it doesn't exist.
- Added support for NEXTSTEP 3.3. (I got a NeXT, what can I say?)

version 1.0.0
=============
- Added preliminary support for AIX 3.x.x, AIX 4.x.x, and DEC UNIX to the
  install program.
- Changed to using getopts() for command line processing.  This completely
  breaks long options, but makes short options much easier to use.  See
  the man page for some examples.
- Added the COPYING file just so everyone knows what the copyright is.
- Added the -e option, which is the equivalent of specifiying all the
  information options.
- Removed a lot of duplicate code.

version 0.4.7-final
===================
- Documentation cleanup: documentation is now stored in POD format in
  the source code itself.  This makes it easy to generate man pages, info
  pages, html documents, and other formats straight from the source code.
- You can now specify a list of people to ignore in the output.  This
  is done via the "--ignore=list" or "-i=list" options.  list is a comma
  seperated list of names to ignore. 

version 0.4.7-pre7
==================
- Use the "--ftp" or "-f" options to display logins via ftp.
- The graph now displays an actual percentage.  If a bar is 25 columns long
  (as long as the header above it), then that is 100% of the logins.
- Updated install program to detect SunOS and IRIX.  The installer is now as
  big as the actual program :)

before 0.4.7-pre7
=================
- didn't keep a changelog, therefore everything has changed
